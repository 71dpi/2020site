    <h1>Alex Lockwoods</h1>
    <h2>UX + CREATIVE DIRECTION + MGMT + DESIGN</h2>
    <p>I recognize patterns. I hate when things are more difficult than they need to be. I can harness patterns to make things clearer. I can make it real pretty so it doesn't offend the senses. That being said, my handle across the internet is <a href="http://www.twitter.com/71dpi">@71dpi</a> because I firmly believe that a good idea and clear communication is always more important than visual resolution or aesthetic. No problem was ever solved in 4k that couldn't have been solved in 720p.</p>
    <p>I'm an activator. I bring people together around an idea. I may not dance, but I'll be the first at the party to suggest a board game or a good drink. I appreciate the collective energy and knowledge working in a group gives me access to. I'm good at organizing people and processes to get things done.</<p>
    <p>I grew up on the internet. People's behavior online fascinates me. How we use software and react to new gadgets is exciting to me. I love that people will always find ways to break your thing or do it better. This creates endless challenge and learning opportunities. Creating and curating digital experiences and art is an ongoing process. In my opinion this is much more exciting than the finite world of traditional marketing.</p>
