    TL;DR
</div>
<h6>For GE Aviation's Supply Chain, who has dozen of plants and suppliers, Alex Lockwood's research produced ecosystem maps that simplify decision making. Unlike reactionary countermeasures, these maps use empathy to inform strategy that impacts real people
    and processes.</h6>
<p>After moving to another area of the business, I was asked to return to help with new delivery challenges. Along with an interaction designer I engaged in a two month research effort. </p>
<h2>Systems Thinking</h2>
<p>The ask was to map out the entirety of the supply chain from end to end. Stakeholders wanted plot pain points with direct impact on delivery. Additionally, we created empathy maps to capture how people were affected. Comprehensive process maps were created.
    People and their pains were added alongside process gaps. Databases and transactional systems were included as well.</p>
<h2>Visualizing the Complex</h2>
<p>Interactive versions of the maps were created so people could choose their context. People could choose to look at the supply chain through the lens of an org, a persona, a process, or a technology space. Black belts and Lean experts could focus on the
    processes. Leadership could focus on the people. Together, they could make plans that improved delivery time without negatively impacting people.</p>
<h2>Okay, now what?</h2>
<p>To make the research more actionable, a pain point matrix accompanies the artifact. The matrix plots pain felt against impact to delivery, vetted by stakeholders. It is paired with a set of recommended process improvements and digital solutions. It documents
    justification and expected outcomes should the recommendations become action items.
</p>
<p>As of drafting this case study, many of these recommendations have come to pass. The strategic research and artifacts produced are iterated upon and revalidated. The partnership between shops, stakeholders, product owners, and UX is stronger than ever.
