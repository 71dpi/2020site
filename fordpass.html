<h1>FordPass App <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> & Art Direction</h1>
<p>FordPass is an app that brings a full service Ford service center experience and vehicle controls to your mobile device. By the end of my engagement, a commercial advertising the app aired during the Super Bowl, and thousands of users were onboarded.
    Over four years later the app sees continuous improvement that garners it a 4.6 star rating average from 180k+ user reviews.</p>

<p>Through service design, UX and UI, I helped inform the FordPass ecosystem past the screen. From the dealership, to ownership, FordPass is designed to be a constant companion to your vehicle.</p>

<p>I worked as a UX designer and art director to deliver concepts and UI designs. I created UI assets to start and stop vehicles, lock and unlock doors, and more. With UX partners I designed financing and parking workflows. I created proof of concept prototypes
    to approach loyalty program partner brands to aid the product owner in pitches.</p>
